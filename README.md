# RapidMiner_Pharamacy
 I have described some of the RapidMiner functions/ processes which can help a pharmacist to do their day-to-day operations easily and conveniently. This project will show, How RapidMiner can be used for visualizing pharmaceutical data which can be used to create future strategies and plans.
 
After carrying out survey in various pharmacy shops, I have selected three basic operations -
(1) Medical Expenses Report for Customer : Customers tend to look for a Medical Report at the end of the year or end of the month to keep a look at the amount they are expending on medicines. 
(2) Sales Report for HSE : A most common job for a pharmacist is to create a sales report for HSE covering all the medicines which are covered under the state scheme.
(3) Analysing Trend : With the use of RapidMiner, A pharmacist can easily generate trends between drugs and time of the year. This data is helpful in stock management.
